This is the deb source of the package Anguix-Installer, which makes the installation of Anguix very simple: you just need to install the deb package.
To clone the git, do "git clone git://github.com/xela92/Anguix.git"
The build.sh script helps you to build the deb. To use it, just do "./build.sh" outside the directory "DEB" (in the dir you cloned the git).
