This is the new script Anguix-Installer, the DEB has been removed because 
had limitations we couldn't stand.
To clone the git, do "git clone git://github.com/xela92/Anguix.git".
Anguix-installer_nobinary: doesn't include the tar, is for human reading.
build.sh creates the Anguix-installer script. To create the installer, just do
"./build.sh" inside the ~/Anguix folder.
Then, install Anguix with ./Anguix-installer (you will be requested the 
password)
You can now install Anguix through GUI, just double click on the build.sh, do
"exec", and then double click on Anguix-installer and "exec".
Then you'll have a basic GUI.
