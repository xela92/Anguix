This is the new script Anguix-Installer, the DEB has been removed because had limitations we couldn't stand.
To clone the git, do "git clone git://github.com/xela92/Anguix.git".
Anguix-installer_nobinary: doesn't include the tar, is for human reading.
build.sh creates the Anguix-installer script. To use it, just do "./build.sh"
inside the ~/Anguix folder.
